#include "image_processor.hpp"

// alright so state of our class at the moment:
// struct of HSV values (probably named something like....HSV because creativity is hard)
// class called ImageProcessor (?) that has a private member variable that is a vector of vectors of HSV (name..?) probably named something logical like image
// one function to read from a file/buffer and store the data in said private member variable
// a function rgbToHsv
// and a function hsvToRgb
// because at least one of those will be used in the first function
// and then a function for each task
